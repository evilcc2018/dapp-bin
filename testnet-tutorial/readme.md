## Asimov Tutorial Project

This repository contains following documentations:

- Documentations on [Asimov node setup](./node.md) and [Asimov chrome wallet](./asilink.md).
- Documentations on Asimov blockchain official tools including [Web IDE tool](./ide-tool.md) and [CMD tool](./cmd.md).
- Documentations on [RPC API](./rpc.md).
- Documentations on [Contract Development](./tutorial-contract.md).

There is a [tutorial contract](./src/contracts/tutorial.sol) which demostrates how to utilize the exclusive Asimov asset instructions in smart contract. There are also test cases written in both [solidity](./src/tc-solidity/tutorial.tc.sol) and [javascript](./src/tc-javascript/tutorial.tc.js).

The main target readers are smart contract and dapp developers on Asimov who should at least have basic knowledge on:

- Blockchain and smart contract
- Ethereum VM and Solidity
